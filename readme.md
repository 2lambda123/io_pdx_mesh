### IO PDX MESH
This project aims to allow editing of mesh and animation files used in the various Clausewitz Engine games created by [Paradox Development Studios](https://www.paradoxplaza.com) It's designed to run in *both* Maya and Blender.

### Download
Click here to view the [latest relase](https://github.com/ross-g/io_pdx_mesh/releases/latest) and download the __*io_pdx_mesh.zip*__ file (this works with both Maya and Blender).

#### Maya Installation
Go to your Maya scripts path. (eg on Windows: `C:\Users\...\Documents\maya\scripts`)  
Extract the contents of the zip file directly into this path.  
Start Maya and change the Comand Line to Python.  
Then use the command `import io_pdx_mesh` to launch the tool.  
(you can highlight this and use the middle-mouse button to drag that command into a shelf button to save it)  

#### Blender Installation
Start Blender and open the `User Preferences` panel, switch to the `Add-ons` tab.  
Select `Install Add-on from file` and pick the zip file you have downloaded.  
Enable the add-on and you should now see a new tab in the `Tool Shelf` of the `3D View`.
